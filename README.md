# What's the point of this repo?
Honestly, I'm not sure. Everything is oddly specific.

# Okay well what is here at least?
Well, there's:
* a script that can help you be extra lazy when playing bingo
* a script that can help you grab some programs on a fresh Windows install (I think the syntax is broken if you don't have chocolatey installed, but I'll get around to it)
* **NEW!** a script for people who own a G14 and want to disable boost on their CPU

# You're an incredible salesman
Thanks, I'm really trying.
